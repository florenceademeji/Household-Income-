# Analyzing Household Income in Greater Louisville Area

## Description
This project investigates household incomes in the Greater Louisville area, utilizing a dataset from a random survey conducted by Greater Louisville Inc (GLI). Through various statistical models, we aim to understand the significance of different variables in predicting household income, the impact of education and work hours, and the likelihood of achieving a higher income. This analysis will provide valuable insights into income dynamics, helping to inform policy and business decisions.

## Technologies
SPSS (Statistical analysis)

Excel (Data manipulation)

## Dataset:

The data is from a survey conducted by Greater Louisville Inc.

## Task List
Determine the significance of all variables in modeling household income

Model the total number of hours worked per week

Assess the impact of an interaction term between EDUC and HRS1 on annual household income

Model the likelihood of a household income exceeding $75,000

## Final Thoughts:
The analysis provides valuable insights into household income dynamics in the Louisville metro area. The preferred reduced model excludes CHILDS and HEAD. Total hours worked are effectively modeled using AGE, EDUC, and HEAD. The interaction term between EDUC and HRS1 is significant but does not drastically alter predictions. Logistic regression effectively models the likelihood of income exceeding $75,000, highlighting the importance of education and work hours.
